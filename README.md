# shellProgressBar
Show simple bar progresses passing a number.

A adaptation to shell from python code.

Python code in [Haoyi's Programming Blog](https://www.lihaoyi.com/post/BuildyourownCommandLinewithANSIescapecodes.html).

The original project uses ANSI code. I decided to use Tput to move cursors and ANSI to colored text.

Command use exemple:
./progressBar.sh 10 #to have 10 bars
./progressBar.sh 5 #to have 5 bars
